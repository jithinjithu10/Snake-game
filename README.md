# Snake Game with Hand Gesture Control

This is a Python-based Snake Game where you control the snake using your hand gestures, specifically the index finger. The game uses a webcam to detect hand movements, and the snake moves in the direction of the index finger.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone

You can install the required packages using the following:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone



This project is a fun and interactive Python-based implementation of the classic Snake Game, where you control the snake using your hand gestures. By detecting the movement of your index finger, the game dynamically adjusts the snakeâ€™s direction. The game utilizes a webcam to track your hand's position and OpenCV for image processing.

Features:
Hand Gesture Control: Move the snake up, down, left, or right by using your index finger.
Random Food Generation: Food spawns at random locations, and the snake must eat it to grow.
Score Tracker: Displays the score based on the food eaten by the snake.
Game Over Condition: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language for the game logic.
OpenCV: Used to capture the webcam feed and process images for hand gesture recognition.
cvzone: A library for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
