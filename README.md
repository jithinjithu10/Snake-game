# Snake Game with Hand Gesture Control

This is a Python-based Snake Game where you control the snake using your hand gestures, specifically the index finger. The game uses a webcam to detect hand movements, and the snake moves in the direction of the index finger.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone

You can install the required packages using the following:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone
```

## Project Description

This project is a fun and interactive Python-based implementation of the classic Snake Game, where you control the snake using your hand gestures. By detecting the movement of your index finger, the game dynamically adjusts the snakeâ€™s direction. The game utilizes a webcam to track your hand's position and OpenCV for image processing.

### Features:
- **Hand Gesture Control**: Move the snake up, down, left, or right by using your index finger.
- **Random Food Generation**: Food spawns at random locations, and the snake must eat it to grow.
- **Score Tracker**: Displays the score based on the food eaten by the snake.
- **Game Over Condition**: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language for the game logic.
- **OpenCV**: Used to capture the webcam feed and process images for hand gesture recognition.
- **cvzone**: A library for hand tracking and gesture recognition.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python cvzone
    ```

3. Run the game by executing the Python script:

    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```

4. The game window will appear, and you can control the snake using your index finger detected by the webcam.

## How to Close the Game

To exit the game, press the 'q' key while the game window is open. The game will close, and the program will terminate.

## Troubleshooting

- **Webcam not detected**: Ensure that the webcam is properly connected and accessible. You can check if the camera works in other applications.
- **Hand gestures not detected properly**: Adjust the position and distance of your hand from the camera for better recognition.
